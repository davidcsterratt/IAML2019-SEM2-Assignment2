    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important that you follow the instructions below carefully for things to work properly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to set up and activate your environment as you would do for your labs, i.e. by reading the instructions in the labs [README](https://github.com/davidcsterratt/iaml-labs) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read the instructions in this notebook carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the required code/markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `.csv` files that you will be using are located in the `./datasets` directory that is included in the git repository with this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <span style=\"color:red\">Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered in 2-3 lines.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to distinguish between **attributes** (columns of the data) and **features** (which typically refers only to the independent variables, i.e. excluding the target variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will account for 25% of your final mark. We ask you\n",
    "to submit answers to all questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submissions will be made on Learn, on a specific page that will be set up and announced before the deadline.** You can find details on how the submission on Learn works [here](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/ilts/2019/09/27/assignment-hand-ins-for-learn-guidance-for-students/). You need only submit this file, filled in with your answers (please do not rename it). Please **save the file with cells run** such that any output has been already produced. We recommend that you make sure all cells run by selecting **Kernel->Restart & Run all** before you submit. Allow 20 minutes for this, as some of the cells take some time to run.\n",

The data was collected from the [Emerging Markets Information Service (EMIS)](https://www.emis.com/), which is a database containing information on emerging markets around the world. The bankrupt companies were analysed over the period 2000-2012. The companies still operating were analysed from 2007 to 2013. This data is hosted at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data#).\n",

Pass it a `DecisionTree` classifier  with the splitting criterion set to `entropy` and, for reproducibility, with the `random_state` set to 0.  The metric is specified by setting the `scoring` parameter of `GridSearchCV` to `f1`. Use the `fit` method with the training data to fit the decision trees.
